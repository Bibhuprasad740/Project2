# Project2
WHAT THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT: This is a fun game projct named '*Tic Tac Toy Game*' that I used to play very often in my childhood days.
                            I used to win everytime I play,and now as I'm learning android development; from curiocity I made this game.
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: This is a two player game in which 9 boxes are there and you have to select one at a time in your turn and you own that 
                      box for the whole of the game. 'X' is appeared first always on the box selected and then 'O'. Like this 'X' and 'O' will 
                      keep appearing on the boxes alternatively on choosing them. The player that has 3 contiguous rows or columns or in any diagonal 
                      first, will be declaired the winner.
                      
                    HEY! NO COMPARISONS, THIS IS MY FIRST GAME. ENJOY.
